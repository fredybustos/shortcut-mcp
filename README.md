## Responses

All tools return JSON in the following format:

```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "message": "Description of the result",
  "user": { ... },  // Information about the found user
  "epics": [ ... ], // Array of epics (if applicable)
  "stories": [ ... ] // Array of stories (if applicable)
}
```

## Error Handling

The server handles various types of errors:
- User not found by email
- Authentication errors with Shortcut API
- Network errors
- Malformed API responses

All errors are returned in the standard format with `success: false` and a descriptive message.

## Limitations

- Email search requires listing all workspace members (no direct email search endpoint in Shortcut)
- Pagination limits are set by default to avoid very large responses
- A valid API token with read permissions in the workspace is required
